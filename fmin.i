func fmin(f, a, b, lim, tol=, all=, eps=)
/* DOCUMENT fmin(f, a, b)
       -or- fmin(f, a, b, lim)
     Get the location  of the minimum of univariate function  F(X).  F is a
     Yorick  function,  A and  B  are bounds  or  starting  values for  the
     variable X and optional LIM specifies the kind of limits for X:
       If LIM=0 or nil, there is no bounds for X: F is first evaluated at A
         and B, then the interval of  search is enlarged until a minimum is
         bracketed.
       If LIM=1,  the interval is bounded by  A: F is first  evaluated at B
         and  the interval is  enlarged (away  from A)  until a  minimum is
         bracketed  --  i.e.  the location of  the  minimum X is such that:
         A < X, if A < B; or A > X, if A > B.
       If LIM=2, the  interval is bounded by B (same as  with LIM=1 but the
         role of A and B exchanged).
       If LIM=3, the minimum is searched  in the interval (A,B) -- i.e. the
         location of the minimum X is such that: min(A,B) < X < max(A,B).

     Keyword  TOL can be  used to  specify the  relative precision  for the
     solution.  The default value is TOL=sqrt(EPS) (see below).

     If keyword ALL  is true (non-nil and non-zero)  the returned value is:
     [X, FX, XLO, XHI] where X is the approximated location of the minimum,
     FX is F(X) and XLO and XHI are the lower and upper bounds for the true
     minimum; otherwise, only X is returned.

     Keyword EPS  can be  used to specify  the machine  relative precision.
     Default value is EPS~2.22e-16,  which corresponds to IEEE standard for
     double precision.

   NOTES:
     (1) The  minimization routine  should never evaluates  F at  the given
         bounds if any.
     (2) If the function F(X) is  not unimodal, only a local minimum can be
         found.

   REFERENCES:
     The method is  based on original Brent's method  modified to allow for
     different kind of bounds (both, left, right or none).

     Find the global minimum of an univariate function F.  The argument X
     is a vector of coordinates in monotonic order; X(1) and X(0) are the
     endpoints of the global search interval and the other values of X are
     such that no more than a single local minimum lies in any subinterval
     [X(i),X(i+2)].

     X = span(A,B,N) if these raguments are supplied instead; i.e. the
     global search is performed in the (included) interval [A,B] which is
     cut in N pieces of equal lengths.

     If specified, TOL is the relative precision.

     This function implements the BraDi ("Bracket" then "Dig") algorithm
     described in [1].
