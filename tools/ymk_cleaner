#! /bin/sed -f
#
# This SED script is a filter to Yorick Makefile.  The following
# operations are performed:
#   - Trailing spaces are removed.
#   - Tabulations are left unchanged (this is intended for Makefiles).
#   - Unix-like end of line markers are used (LF).
#   - Macros like Y_HOME which are overwritten by 'yorick -batch make.i' are
#     cleared.
